# First IronHack project

Pizza Hunt is my first Ironhack Web Dev bootcamp project. With this game i am supposed to make use of what i learned about HTML5/CSS3 & javascript. Two of my objectives was to write a game implementing object oriented programming and canvas.    

## Instructions

Pizza Hunt is a game where you have to catch as many pizzas as you can and avoid being hit by the vilan Shredder. To play it you use the left and right arrow keys in your keyboard.

### About the theme

The theme of the game being the Ninja Turtles is due to my childwood where i remember waking up early in the weekends to not miss an episode of my favourite heroes. 

### What i wanted to transmit

Once back in the 90's all games were quite simple and had these retro sound effects that would make everything feel more emersive, i wanted to see if i could replicate something similar that back in the days would make me spend all my coins to play it.
 
### Steps to make it

- Create the GitHub repository & ReadMe
- Build the foundation files of HTML, CSS and JS
- Create the different JS Classes in order to be OOP
- Implement collisions system
- Get and add character, obstacles and background images
- Design the game screen
- Add audio to game-start and collisions
- Refactor functions 
- Fix bugs

### Unsolved or not implemented

- Refactor some functions
- Audio in collisions that are to close to each other
- Advanced animations effects

### Share the knowledge

If there are things you would implement in a different way or if you found something useful in here let me know!

Thanks for reading!!
